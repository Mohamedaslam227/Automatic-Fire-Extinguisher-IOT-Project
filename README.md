# Automatic-Fire-Extinguisher-IOT-Project
The Automatic Fire Extinguisher system uses an Arduino Uno to detect fire and smoke. A flame sensor triggers a water pump, while a smoke sensor activates an exhaust fan and buzzer. The L298 motor module efficiently controls the pump and fan. Powered by a 12V supply, the system ensures reliable, autonomous operation.
